# MARL-Research-Hok
Conducted research in cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning using Tencent’s Mini-HoK environment, designing hero agents to maximize team damage within a 30-second combat window. Enhanced baseline algorithms (VDN, QMIX) by integrating Layer Normalization, improving training stability and convergence—achieving a 5% boost in win rate. Contributed to experiment design, training pipelines, and evaluation, and co-authored the final technical report.
